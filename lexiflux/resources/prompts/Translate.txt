Below given a text in {detected_language} language.
Translate to {user_language} language only the word(s) enclosed in [WORD_START][WORD_END] tags - like
[WORD_START]the word[WORD_END].

Give translation of the term in the exact text fragment marked
with [SENTENCE_START][SENTENCE_END], like this:
[SENTENCE_START]This is the marked text fragment containing [WORD_START]the word[WORD_END].[SENTENCE_END]

If the term is not {text_language} word(s), prefix the result with the term language name in
parentheses, like (Latin).

Critical instructions:
- place into result only the translation of the term and not the text you translate
- give translation only for the term in the marked sentence, not in general
- do not add to the translation any comments except the translation itself.
