Alice’s Evidence <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> CHAPTER I. <br/> Down the Rabbit-Hole <br/> <br/> <br/> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the <br/> bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into <br/> the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or <br/> conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice <br/> “without pictures or conversations?” <br/> <br/> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the <br/> hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of <br/> making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and <br/> picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran <br/> close by her. <br/> <br/> There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it <br/> so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh <br/> dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, <br/> it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the <br/> time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a <br/> watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried <br/> on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she <br/> had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a <br/> watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the <br/> field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a <br/> large rabbit-hole under the hedge. <br/> <br/> In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how <br/> in the world she was to get out again. <br/> <br/> The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then <br/> dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think <br/> about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very <br/> deep well. <br/> <br/> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had <br/> plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what <br/> was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out <br/> what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she <br/> looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with <br/> cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures <br/> hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she <br/> passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great <br/> disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear <br/> of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the <br/> cupboards as she fell past it. <br/> <br/>
