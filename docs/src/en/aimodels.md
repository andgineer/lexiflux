# AI Models

Lexiflux use AI models to create `Lexical Articles` in `Sidebar`
(you open it with blue binocular icon).

Also you can use AI for inline text translation. By default
it uses Google Translate.

To configure Sidebar and inline translation see [Language Preferences](http://localhost:6100/language-preferences/).
There are separate settings for each language, so you can configure
different settings for different languages.

## Ollama
You can [install](docker.md#local-ollama-ai) in the docker local AI [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) model.

It is free, but requires about 6G RAM to run. Remember this is RAM for the Docker container, not for the host machine.

And it is not very accurate.

## OpenAI (ChatGPT), Anthropic (Claude) and others

To use commercial AI providers you need `API KEY`.

See [AI Settings](http://localhost:6100/ai-settings/) section how to get one for different AI providers.
